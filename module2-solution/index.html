                    <p class="article-body">Sushi is traditionally made with 
                        medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown 
                        rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with 
                        seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or 
                        imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is 
                        often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. 
                        Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes 
                        for the dish.</p>

                    <p class="article-body">Beef is the third most widely consumed 
                        meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production
                        worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.
                        In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the 
                        People's Republic of China are the world's three largest 
                        consumers of beef. On a per capita basis in 2009, Argentines 
                        consumed the most beef at 64.6 kg per person; people in the 
                        U.S. ate 40.2 kg, while those in the E.U. ate 16.9 kg.</p>
